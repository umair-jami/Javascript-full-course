//AJAX is a set of "web development techniques"
//using many web technologies on the "client-side"
//to creat asynchronous web applications

//with Ajax ,web application can send and retrieve
//data from a server asynchronusly(in the background)
//without interfering with the display and
//behaviour of existing page
